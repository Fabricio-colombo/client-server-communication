### Client-Server Communication Example
This project demonstrates a simple client-server communication using C for the client and Python for the server. It showcases basic TCP socket programming where the client sends a request to the server, and the server responds accordingly. The client is implemented in C, while the server is implemented in Python, making it a cross-language client-server application.

The project includes:

A C client (client.c) that establishes a TCP connection to the server and sends a message.
A Python server (server.py) that listens for incoming connections on a specific port and responds with a message to the client.
This is a basic example suitable for learning the fundamentals of network programming, client-server architecture, and how to establish communication over TCP sockets.

Technologies used:

C for the client-side
Python for the server-side
TCP socket communication to facilitate the communication between client and server
